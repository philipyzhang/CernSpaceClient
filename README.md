## About This Project
This project was made by our team during CERN Webfest 2020. It was  
devised as a way of helping CERN run their simulations. By allowing  
the public to help compute CERN's various experiments, the  
public becomes more engaged and CERN has increased compute power to  
do calculations and simulations.  

## How It Works
This is at its very core, a giant book of docker swarms you can join  
that can help various projects at CERN.
